# Icons

This repository contains custom icons that I have created for various projects. Included is the Sketch file used to draw the icons, the individual .svg file for each icon, and a web font of all the icons. The web font is generated from the svg files using the webfont npm package. To see examples of all the icons, visit the [demo page](https://aaronpinero.github.io/pinero-icons/).
