# Icons

This repository contains custom icons that I have created for various projects. Included is the Sketch file used to draw the icons, the individual .svg file for each icon, and a web fonts (3 weights) of all the icons. The web fonts are generated from the svg files using the svgtofont npm package. To see examples of all the icons, visit the [demo page](https://aaronpinero.github.io/pinero-icons/).
