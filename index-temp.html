      <p class="my-4">Over the years I have created several custom icons. I did this mostly to avoid the need to use a very large icon font like FontAwesome. FontAwesome does allow users to create font subsets to reduce file size and eliminate unnecessary icons. However, that feature requires a paid license. Some projects just need a few free fonts. This is what these icons are for.</p>
      <p class="my-4">There are currently <strong>30</strong> icons in the set. They are published as a font with the name <strong>pineroicons</strong>.</p>
      <p class="my-4">The example icons below are shown at 3x normal size.</p>
